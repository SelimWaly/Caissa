## History / Originality

The engine is written completely from scratch. In early versions it was using simple PeSTO evaluation, then replaced with Stockfish NNUE for a short period of time. Since version 0.7, Caissa uses it's own efficiently-updated neural network trained with Caissa self-play games using custom trainer. Thus, in some sense the first own Caissa net is based on Stockfish's net, however it was much weaker because of small data set used back then (few million positions). Currently (as of version 1.7) there were over 750M newly generated positions used. Also, the old selfplay games are successively purged so that the newer nets are trained only on most recent games generated by most recent net, and so on.

Runtime neural network evaluation code is placed in [PackedNeuralNetwork.cpp](https://github.com/Witek902/Caissa/blob/devel/src/backend/PackedNeuralNetwork.cpp) and was inspired by [nnue.md document](https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md). The neural network trainer is written completely from scratch and is located in [NetworkTrainer.cpp](https://github.com/Witek902/Caissa/blob/devel/src/utils/NetworkTrainer.cpp), [NeuralNetwork.cpp](https://github.com/Witek902/Caissa/blob/devel/src/utils/NeuralNetwork.cpp) and other NeuralNetwork* files. The trainer is purely CPU-based and is heavily optimized to utilize many threads and AVX instructions as well as it exploits sparse nature of the nets.

The games are generated with [SelfPlay.cpp](https://github.com/Witek902/Caissa/blob/devel/src/utils/SelfPlay.cpp) utility that generates games at fixed node count / depth and dumps them to custom binary game format to save space. The opening books used are either Stefan's Pohl [UHO books](https://www.sp-cc.de/uho_2022.htm) or DFRC (Double Fischer Random Chess) openings with few random moves played at the beginning.

### Supported UCI options

* **Hash** (int) Sets transposition table size in megabytes.
* **MultiPV** (int) Specifies number of searched and printed PV lines.
* **MoveOverhead** (int) Sets move overhead in milliseconds. Should be increased if the engine is loosing on time.
* **Threads** (int) Sets number of threads used for searching.
* **Ponder** (bool) Enables pondering.
* **EvalFile** (string) Neural network evaluation file.
* **SyzygyPath** (string) Semicolon-separated list of paths to Syzygy endgame tablebases.
* **SyzygyProbeLimit** (int) Maximum number of piece on the board where Syzygy tablebases can be used.
* **GaviotaTbPath** (string) Path to Gaviota endgame tablebases.
* **GaviotaTbCache** (int) Gaviota cache size in megabytes.
* **UCI_AnalyseMode** (bool) Enables analysis mode: search full PV lines and disable any depth constrains.
* **UseSAN** (bool) Enables short algebraic notation output (FIDE standard) instead of default long algebraic notation.
* **ColorConsoleOutput** (bool) Enables colorful console output for better readability.


### Provided EXE versions

* **AVX2/BMI2** Fastest, requires a x64 CPU with AVX2 and BMI2 instruction set support.
* **POPCNT** Slower, requires a x64 CPU with SSE4 and POPCNT instruction set support.
* **Legacy** Slowest, requires any x64 CPU.

## Modules

The projects comprises following modules:
  * _backend_ (library) - engine's core
  * _frontend_ (executable) - UCI wrapper for the backend
  * _utils_ (executable) - various utilities, such as unit tests, neural network trainer, self-play data generator, etc.
